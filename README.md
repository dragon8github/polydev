## Rationale

As your project grows, **working on a large or monolithic [Node.js][node] app gets slower**:

- Working on _part_ of the app means running the _entire_ app.
- The `require` tree grows so large it can take several seconds to start the server.
- Restarting the server on every change impedes development.
- Middleware for projects like [Next.js][next] & [Storybook][storybook] are expensive
  to restart with each change.
- Tools like [concurrently][concurrently], [nodemon][nodemon], & [piping][piping] still
  run the entire app.
- You shouldn't waste time in the terminal hitting <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd> and restarting.

## Features

- Fast startup.
- [Hot Module Replacement][hmr] built-in.
- Run only the parts of your app that's requested.
- Supports [yarn workspaces][workspaces].
- Pretty `404` screens with the option to create the missing route.
- Pretty `500` screens, so you spend less time in the terminal.
- Iterative adoption, so it's easy to get started.

## Quick Started

1. Install

   ```shell
   yarn add polydev --dev
   ```

2. Run `polydev`

   ```shell
   yarn run polydev --open
   ```

For customizing the `node` runtime, you can use `NODE_OPTIONS`.

For example, [TypeScript][typescript] can be enabled via [ts-node][ts-node]:

```shell
polydev --require ts-node/register
# Or
NODE_OPTIONS="--require ts-node/register" polydev
```

## Defining `routes`

The `routes` folder is similar to Old-Time&trade; HTML & PHP, where
**folders mirror the URL structure**, followed by an `index.js` file:

- `routes/`

  - `page/[id]/index.js`

    _Has access to `req.params.id` for [/page/123](http://localhost:3000/page/123)._

  - `contact-us/`

    - `index.get.js`
    - `index.post.js`

  - `posts/index.*.js`

    _Responds to both `GET` & `POST` for [/posts/\*](http://localhost:3000/posts)._

  - `index.js`

    _Responds to both `GET` & `POST` for [/](http://localhost:3000/)._

### Route Handlers

Route handlers can be any of the following:

1. Functional middleware:

   ```js
   module.exports = (req, res) => {
     res.send("Howdy there!")
   }
   ```

2. Express apps:

   ```js
   const express = require("express")

   module.exports = express().get("/", (req, res) => {
     res.send(`Howdy from ${req.path}!`)
   })
   ```

3. A [yarn workspace][workspaces] package:

   ```js
   module.exports = require("my-package-name")
   ```

4. A `package.json` path:

   ```js
   module.exports = require.resolve("my-app/package.json")
   ```

   These are considered stand-alone apps that will be ran via `yarn dev` or `yarn start` (whichever exists) for development only.

   This is good for when you want to have a separate API server open on `process.env.PORT` that's not part of your application.
